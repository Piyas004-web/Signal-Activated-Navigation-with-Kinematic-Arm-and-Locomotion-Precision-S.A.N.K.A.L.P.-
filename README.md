S.A.N.K.A.L.P. (Signal-Activated Navigation with Kinematic Arm and Locomotion Precision) is a dual-microcontroller robotic system developed by Team Event_Horizon. It features an ESP32 for Bluetooth-based locomotion control and an Arduino UNO R3 for precise manipulation of a cantilever-based robotic arm using two stepper motors and a 9g servo. The bot uses four BO motors driven via an L298N motor driver for movement, and communicates internally using UART with voltage divider protection. The ESP32 handles user input over Bluetooth, processes motion commands, and transmits arm control instructions to the Arduino. The Arduino uses a custom stepper motor control class with timed movement logic and stores servo angle persistently using EEPROM.

The project ensures smooth and realistic motor motion using a sinusoidal PWM profile and includes disconnect timeout logic for safety. Core features include persistent speed/angle storage via EEPROM, modular motor functions, and UART-based cross-board communication. This project was demonstrated at SRIJAN 2K25, the annual tech fest of Jadavpur University, where it was selected as a finalist.
